  abstract = {The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.}

  abstract = {This study examined how a suite of habitat and environmental variables relate to the ability of a stream surveyor to identify (observer efficiency) and distinguish (observer accuracy) steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) redds from other stream features. Two existing spawning survey protocols that included one or two redd observers were used to develop models to estimate redd observer error. In most cases, steelhead redd abundances using raw redd counts were underestimated. Mean annual rates of observer efficiency ranged from 0.44 to 0.57, and observer accuracy ranged from 0.67 to 0.83. Regardless of the observer error model used, adjusted annual redd abundance estimates were generally unbiased (range 1.6\textendash 0.6 redds). A Gaussian area-under-the-curve methodology that incorporates redd count data and observer error rates was used to generate unbiased estimates of steelhead redd abundance in the Wenatchee (170 redds, coefficient of variation (CV) = 44\%) and Methow (106 redds, CV = 41\%) rivers. Unbiased estimates of redd abundance will help inform new population viability analyses to better prioritize those populations with the greatest conservation need.},
